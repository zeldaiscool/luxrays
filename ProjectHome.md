This is a mirror repository of http://src.luxrender.net/luxrays

This repository is updated every 24 hours via cron job.

If you are writing Luxrays installers it is suggested (by me) that you clone from this repository instead of cloning directly from http://src.luxrender.net/luxrays

This repository is faster, more reliable, and costs nothing for hosting fees.

Please do not contact me requesting commit privileges, this is only a mirror, all commits must go to the main luxrender repository.
